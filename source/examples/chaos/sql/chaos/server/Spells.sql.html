      >Spells come in a number of flavours, the user interface breaks them down into the same groups that the original chaos instructions did:</p
      ><p
      >wizard spells: upgrade your wizard in some way, most add weaponry</p
      ><p
      >attacking spells: are cast directly on enemy wizards and their monsters to kill them or destroy all of a wizards creations.</p
      ><p
      >object spells: create object pieces, which are pieces which aren't moved by the wizard, all the other spells which create pieces are monster spells</p
      ><p
      >miscellaneous spells: various spells not in the other categories</p
      ><p
      >monster spells: summon monsters for a wizard's army</p
      ><p
      >The code breaks the spells down differently: target spells need a square to be chosen to cast them on activate spells are all the other spells.</p
      ><p
      >Target spells are further be broken down into summon spells which create new pieces on the board, and all the other target spells.</p
      ><p
      >casting chance notes:</p
      ><p
      >Each time you cast a spell it can affect the world alignment, which in turn affects the spell casting chances in the future, this is critical to most playing strategies.</p
