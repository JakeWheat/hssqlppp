# Compiling and running the tests

To be fleshed out...

A full compile from scratch involves the following steps:

recompile the AstInternals.hs from AstInternals.ag et al using
uuagc. See src/Database/AstInternals/AstInternals.ag for instructions

update the antinodes using devel/MakeAntiNodes.lhs, see this file for
instructions

compile the tests executable using something like:

ghc -XScopedTypeVariables -XDeriveDataTypeable -cpp -pgmPcpphs -optP--cpp --make -isrc:tests:devel:examples/chaos/:examples/extensions/:examples/util/:examples/wrappers/ tests/Tests.lhs

run them using
tests/Tests.lhs

expect 12 failures at the moment, which are in the broken typechecker,
and not likely to be fixed for a while.
