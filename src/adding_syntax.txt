# Adding new syntax

This is an example of how to add new syntax to the library. The basic steps are:

add tests to the appropriate file under tests/

compile and run the tests to check the new test fails

add new datatypes to AstInternals.ag

fix any default uuagc rules if needed (the typechecker supports
untypeable syntax reasonably gracefully at the moment so it can
partially type check asts)

run devel/MakeAntiNodes.lhs which is a crazy-baroque system to support
the quasi-quotation system. Not sure how to make this non-crazy

compile and run the tests to check that the new test now passes
