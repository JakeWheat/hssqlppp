# HsSqlPpp

Here are a few pages that might help you get started with working with
the HsSqlPpp source code:

The code is in a bit of a transition period at the moment. I fixed the
parser to handle a lot more sql, but the typecheck regressed quite a
lot and hasn't been fixed yet. My next job for hssqlppp is
implementing a production quality typechecker for queries, but no ETA
yet.

Parsing sql expressions is still a horrible broken mess and needs a
rethink from scratch.

The quasi-quotation is at a very early stage.

I have plans to implement very simple syntax extension support, with
some sort of extensible syntax and parsing. The idea would be to be
able to read extended syntax and then convert to normal sql and
plpgsql before type checking.
