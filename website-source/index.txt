A parser, pretty printer, and type checker for SQL written in
Haskell. Targets the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL and PL/pgSQL
syntax only. BSD licensed.

Purpose
=======

Possible uses of this library include:

* type-checker can help with SQL development and catch bugs which
  aren't statically detected by Postgres
* front end for a sql dbms
* generating SQL code programmatically/ generating SQL from some other
  source, e.g. for implementing non sql code on a sql dbms
* transforming SQL code, possibly using quasiquoting, e.g. writing
  PL/pgSQL with less boilerplate, or optimisation rewrites
* viewing the catalog produced by some SQL code

With some extra work:

* generating documentation for SQL code
* support running one dialect of SQL on a different DBMS using
  automatic translation - portable SQL
* typesafe database access from Haskell
* lint or semantic analysis for SQL or PL/pgSQL

Status
======

Pre-alpha in the traditional sense (not yet feature complete). Support
for parsing SQL solid on a large subset of SQL. Supports queries/DML
and DDL. Here is an extract from the parsing tests which gives some
examples of what can currently be parsed:

* [Parsing examples](ParserTests.html)

The type checker is currently still being fixed after some reworking
of parsing and ast types. It is pretty solid on a wide range of
queries.

Extract from the type checking tests:

* [Type-checking examples](TypeCheckTests.html)

Currently limited support for quasiquoting, here are the extracts from
the tests:

* [Quasiquotation examples](QuasiQuoteTests.html)

The pretty printer should support everything the parser supports
(i.e. it pretty prints code which both the parser and Postgres
understand).

Catalog information is limited, supports the type checking. Some
information is collected on scalar types, domains, composite types,
casts, tables, views and functions.
