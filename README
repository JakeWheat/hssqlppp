A parser, pretty printer, and type checker for SQL written in
Haskell. Mainly targets the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL and PL/pgSQL
syntax.

Pre alpha: works well and is stable for a subset of SQL, but there are
lots of unfinished areas and the api is likely to change a lot from
release to release at this time.
