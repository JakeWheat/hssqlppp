      >Here are some things which might be useful to get you up to speed with developing on or using hssqlppp.</p
      ><p
      >For general Haskell, I recommend starting with http://learnyouahaskell.com/ if you haven't already seen it. I found real world haskell (which is also popular and there is a free version online) a bit difficult to follow when I was getting started, and I haven't looked at it much since.</p
      ><p
      >As far as I can tell, there are no clear tutorials for all the interesting intermediate haskell techniques which are really useful for things like parsing, type checking and other ast analysis.</p
      ><p
      >The ast types are created using uuagc. This is an attribute grammar library (more accurately a preprocessor) which accepts a modified haskell syntax to define the ast nodes, producing regular haskell code and data types (the attribute grammar part is used mainly for type checking in hssqlppp itself). There is only one set of ast types, which is used both as a parse tree and for type checking, generating sql, etc.. This is probably a design flaw which could be revisited (there are many design flaws like this in the code - I have taken a very pragmatic approach! For savvy readers, subsitute ignorant for pragmatic).</p

      >Pretty printing:</p
      ><p
      >The pretty printer converts asts into valid sql text source using the 'HughesPJ' pretty printing library. I never really spent time to work out how to use it properly so the layout of the produced source has many redundant parentheses and the whitespace is a bit crazy...</p

      >Parsing is done with the well known Parsec library (version 3.x). The parsing code makes lots of use of something called Applicative style. Parsec may or may not be a good choice, but it does the job at the moment.</p
      ><p
      >The parsing is split into separate lexing and parsing stages, which isn't that conventional for parsec.</p
      ><p
      >Here is a outdated tutorial for parsec which isn't too bad for getting started: http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html</p
      ><p
      >And the chapter from real world haskell which introduces the applicative approach (the main use is that it allows you to write more concise and natural parsing code):</p
      ><p
      >http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html</p
      ><p
      >Another neat thing is something called 'Generics' in the haskell world (not the same as oo generics). hssqlppp mainly uses the uniplate library for this.</p
      ><p
      >http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/uniplate/</p
      ><p
      >This library allows very concise queries and transformations over complicated asts.</p
      ><p
      >The code also supports some limited quasi-quotation, which allows writing flexible sql source embedded in haskell source, which is then converted to sql asts during haskell compile time. This is useful in combination with uniplate to write very concise and clear to understand code (since reading and writing source code directly is much easier than reading and writing the ast representations). I don't think there are any clear tutorials on quasi quotation available. Quasi-quotation works a lot like Template Haskell, so you can look around for that to get some ideas.</p
